\description{
This function performs the clonal alterations differential expression
analysis pairs of clonal sub-populations and perturbed genes.
}
\details{
Given a table of clone and gene pairs, a UMI count matrix, and list of cells
per clone, this function models gene expression (\code{Y}) with a negative
binomial (a.k.a. Gamma-Poisson) distribution for each perturbation pair as
a function of \code{X} (clone indicator variable) offset by the cell total count
(\code{D}) as described by the model:

\deqn{Y ~ NB(xb, theta)}
\deqn{log(xb) = \beta_0 + \beta_x * X + log(D)}
\deqn{theta ~ \mu}

The gene dispersion parameter (\code{theta}) is estimated and regularized in two
steps as developed by Hafemeister & Satija (2019). First, for a subset of
genes it fits a \emph{Poisson} regression offseted by \code{log(D)} and estimate a
crude \code{theta} using a maximum likelihood estimator with the observed counts
and regression results. Next, it regularize and expands \code{theta} estimates
with a kernel smoothing function as a function of average count (\code{mu}).

\title{Simulated scRNA-seq count matrix (1500 x 1000)}
\format{
A sparse count matrix with 1500 rows (features) and 500 columns
(cells).
}
\usage{
sim_decal
}
\description{
The matrix was generated using \code{sim_count()} for a total cell depth
following a log-normal distribution (\eqn{ln(D) ~ N(9, .5)}), a gene
expression rate ranging from 0.0001 to 0.01 in a logarithm scale
and overdispersion (\code{theta}) of 100.
